## Summary
In this demo, python and matlab were used to display a real-time stream of the following:
1. A point cloud plot showing the approximate locations of people in a room.
2. A range-doppler heatmap visualizing the people in a room.
3. A video feed.

Python was used to parse the binary data from the Radar module into a 2D matrix of values corresponding to different ranges and time.
Matlab was used to provide the GUI to visualiize all the charts at the same time.
